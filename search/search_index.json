An informal evening where people share short, enthusiastic presentations about the tech, math, or nerdy topics they love. Each speaker gets 15-20 minutes to introduce something cool: anything from CPU arcana to weird math, game dev tricks, tooling hacks, or deep dives into obscure concepts. The goal isn\u2019t to be polished or academic; It\u2019s to share curiosity, spark interest, and have fun learning together. All topics and skill levels are welcome, as long as you\u2019re excited about it. Come teach, come listen, and come nerd out! Hosted bi-monthly (once every two months) at Thinkin' Rocks* .

They\u2019re not meant to restrict you, just to make sure everyone has a smooth experience and the audience can follow along. These are guidelines and can be bent for the benefit of the presentation. Pick a topic you actually enjoy. Don\u2019t shoehorn yourself into something you don\u2019t love. It can be a workshop, a tour, an introduction to somethinf or an attempt to get people interested. Anything goes! State what you want the audience to take away from it (e.g. \"Understand some unusual cases that the Rust borrow checker can't prove\" or \"What do I need to show for the Collatz Conjecture?\") Structure 2-3 minutes for introduction 12-15 minutes for the main content 1-2 minutes conclusion 3-5 minutes for Q & A The numbers are flexible! Some people need more time, some need less. Just be aware of how much time YOU are taking up. Technicalities Slides are optional, but recommended. You can also use the whiteboard or paper printouts If using slides... Keep the text minimal (code is okay though!) Consider using \"speaker notes\" or an analogous feature Include diagrams, code samples and pictures where helpful Bring your own laptop or have the slides at the ready as a PDF Test the slides on spot, maybe even in advance if possible We also strongly encourage you to PR the the final version of the presentation into our GitHub repository with any other relevant materials Content Keep the content nerdy and juicy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be very complicated Gauge your audience. if you start from the deep end people WILL get lost. provide context as needed and keep it digestable. provide intermediate conclusions If you want to do a live demo, have a fallback like screenshots and or a recorded demo give directions for further explanation if appropriate Delivery State if questions are during or at the end Stay on pace. We might be able go slightly go over time, but don\u2019t expect it to be the norm. Explain jargon the first time you introduce it Be prepared to answer questions, but it\u2019s ok to say \"I don\u2019t know\" Remember that people can be scared of specific topics (usually abstract math). That\u2019s ok, make sure there is enough information on the slides to follow. Example Topics What does npm install actually do? CPU instructions you didn\u2019t know existed Monoids without category theory trauma Examples of timezones being evil Ray-marching black holes Why C# is objectively good Setting up your own git server Hitchhiker\u2019s guide to obscure keyboard switches ECS is just indirections. It\u2019s still faster than OOP. Why? Top 3 algorithms you will never use What we know about umbral calculus What is Stephen Wolfram even on about? Why old robot videos seem as good as modern ones X is an old piece of junk and its my favourite piece of hardware","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"requirements/#requirements","text":"These guidelines are here to help you prepare a fun, clear, and engaging minute talk on any nerdy topic you love!
