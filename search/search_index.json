Don\u2019t shoehorn yourself into something you don\u2019t love. It can be a workshop, a tour, an introduction to somethinf or an attempt to get people interested. Anything goes! State what you want the audience to take away from it (e.g. \"Understand some unusual cases that the Rust borrow checker can\u2019t prove\" or \"Know what is needed to prove the Collatz Conjecture\") Structure 2-3 minutes for introduction 12-15 minutes for the main content 1-2 minutes conclusion 3-5 minutes for Q & A Technicalities Slides are optional, but recommended. You can also use the whiteboard or paper printouts If using slides\u2026 keep the text minimal consider using \"speaker notes\" or an analogous feature include diagrams, code samples and pictures where helpful bring your own laptop or have the slides at the ready as a PDF test the slides on spot, maybe even in advance if possible We also strongly encourage you to PR the the final version of the presentation into our GitHub repository with any other relevant materials Content keep the content nerdy and juicy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be very complicated gauge your audience. if you start from the deep end people WILL get lost. provide context as needed and keep it digestable. provide intermediate conclusions If you want to do a live demo, have a fallback like screenshots and or a recorded demo give directions for further explanation if appropriate Delivery State if questions are during or at the end Stay on pace. We might be able go slightly go over time, but don\u2019t expect it to be the norm. Explain jargon the first time you introduce it Be prepared to answer questions, but it\u2019s ok to say \"I don\u2019t know\" Remember that people can be scared of specific topics (usually abstract math). That\u2019s ok, make sure there is enough information on the slides to follow. Example Topics: * what does npm install actually do? * CPU instructions you didn\u2019t know existed * monoids without category theory trauma * examples of timezones being evil * ray-marching black holes * why C# is objectively good * setting up your own git server * hitchhiker\u2019s guide to obscure keyboard switches * ECS is just indirections. It\u2019s still faster than OOP. * top 3 algorithms you will never use * what we know about umbral calculus * what is Stephen Wolfram even on about?","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"requirements/#requirements","text":"Pick a topic you actually enjoy.
