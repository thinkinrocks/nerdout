# Nerd Out!

An informal evening where people share short, enthusiastic presentations about the tech, math, or nerdy topics they love. Each speaker gets 15-20 minutes to introduce something cool: anything from CPU arcana to weird math, game dev tricks, tooling hacks, or deep dives into obscure concepts. The goal isn’t to be polished or academic; 

It’s to share curiosity, spark interest, and have fun learning together. All topics and skill levels are welcome, as long as you’re excited about it. Come teach, come listen, and come nerd out!

Hosted bi-monthly (once every two months) at [Thinkin' Rocks*](https://www.thinkinrocks.com/).
